{"workshopId":1370689349,"Title":"Breath Attacks by Reflection Rip","Description":"Currently adds 5 new mutations: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Acid Breath, and Force Breath.\n\nThe First 2 are relocated versions of Flaming Hands, and Freezing Hands.  They do the same damage, but have an increased cooldown (25 turns) and a decreased cost (4).\n\nLightning breath is a mix between the Breath Attack code, and the code for Electrical Generation.\n\nAcid breath is similar to the acid vent (wall traps) usually found in Golgotha.\n\nForce breath is a weak but cheap damage attack.  It will be improved later to add a pushing mechanic.\n\nThis is my first Caves Of Qud mod. Leaning how to mod CoQ.\n\nSource can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/ReflectionRip/ReflectionRip_BreathAttacks","Tags":"Mutation, Mutations","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
